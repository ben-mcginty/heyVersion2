          It seems that HEY needs some new features,

          <em>

        <h2 style="font-family: Abril Fatface, cursive;">
          So here you go, and because your service is really cool, possible implementations to take it to production.

        <h2>Some suggestions for the improvement of the HEY email client</h2>
        <h4><em>Note: I haven't used HEY before, so this is what I could see from the <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tour.</a></em></h4>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <div id="themes">
        <h2>Custom Theming</h2>
        <p><strong>So you know how people change their wallpaper(?) and how you can have colour themes in <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-colors-in-windows-d26ef4d6-819a-581c-1581-493cfcc005fe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 10</a>?</strong></p>
        <p>Bringing theming to HEY will give users a next level of customizability. Email is personal, not a space for companies, spammers, just what's important to you. Someone's Imbox is their personal space, and the UI should reflect that.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div id="sideArt">
        <h2>Side Art</h2>
        <p>As previously mentioned, theming is an important part of making the UI more personal for the user. Side art may be a good addition to the user experience of HEY. Given you visual style, with the blobs, I am assuming that you will use that same</p>

      <div id="tabs">
        <h2>Collapsible Unread Zone when empty</h2>
        <p>I think that this is self-explanatory enough, the 'nothing new for you' message takes up a massive amount of space, maybe give users the option to shrink it down a little bit, and then you can see more of your beautiful photo (if configured).</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div id="storageTiers">
        <h2>Storage Tiers</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Some people get 500 emails a day, some get 5, the amount of storage should reflect that.
          </strong>
          <br>
          Some files can be MASSIVE, and some tiny. Certain demands are placed on someone running out of storage space, deleting stuff. The eternal "Do I really need this?" that you are asking yourself. That is very not-going-with-the-flow. And as Jason says in his letter on the hey.com homepage:
          <div style="font-family: 'Lora', serif; padding-left: 35% ; width: 30%; text-align: center;">
            "Now email feels like a chore, rather than a joy. Something you fall behind on. Something you clear out, not cherish. Rather than delight in it, you deal with it."<br>-Jason Fried
          </div>
          <br>
          Jason's comments clearly make the connection between chore, and something cleared out, or disposed of. 100GB is definitely comfortable, but it could be expanded upon. Especially if the decision is made to add file storage / hosting to HEY.

        <h2>Document editing in the HEY client</h2>
        <p><strong>Is it not a pain to have to download, edit, then send back?</strong> Why can't we just edit documents inside of HEY, with it automatically attached? Saving it in the thread would make it easier to find and adding a draft tab would make it a sole place to see all in-progress files. This could also be extended to document viewing inside of the email (this would be significantly easier to implement). From my knowledge .docx, .xlsx and .pptx files are just compressed XML files zipped up. I think that this would fulfill the 'go with the flow' mentality of HEY.</p>

      <div id="animationOnPageLoad">
        <h2>HEY 'wave' animation on page load</h2>
        <p><strong>Easy enough, </strong>a little wave of the HEY hand at start-up.<br>And then right where you left off, reading, and responding to emails.</p>

      <div id="importMail">
        <h2>Importing mail into the 'Treasure Trove'</h2>
        <p><strong>I thought that with HEY, that you 'go with the flow',</strong> so why does moving to HEY make your emails fragmented? Why not import them, and pop everything away in the 'Treasure Trove'? After that, it can be a fresh start.</strong></p>

      <div id="tutorial">
        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <p><strong>I don't think anyone wants to sit through a 37-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walkthrough</a> of the HEY app,</strong> so a tutorial for new users might be good, just letting them know where stuff is, and letting them discover the features on offer. After going through the preliminary walkthrough, a series of tooltips might be beneficial.</p>

        <p style="font-size:75%"><em>An example tutorial message in the Search box and the Imbox.</em></p>
        <p>This may be beneficial as then people do not have to search things up, reducing the barrier of entry<p>

          <h2>SMS/RCS sending</h2>
        </div>
        <p><strong>This is a weird one, have you considered turning HEY from an email service to a communication 'hub'?</strong> I certainly have, which is why it is on this list. So you know how people text, and email, and video call, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AOL</a> (do they still do that?). Given that eSIM's are getting more common, having one hosted on Basecamp infrastructure gives users the ability to send a message from any internet connected device, even if the device hosting the physical SIM is offline. For example, cellular smartwatches allow you to text while the phone is offline, if you swap out the watch with infrastructure and build the supporting application/s (client + server-side), you can have a robust messaging experience without the other hurdles. If Apple lets you integrate iMessage (let's face it, they won't), then you have an offering where (from my awareness) it has never been done before.</p>

          <h2>Instant Messenger</h2>
          <p><strong>This links back into the previous feature, </strong>but for a premium experience for HEY users. I'm sure that some would want an end-to-end encrypted message chain, where their inbox is. I mean, it could be a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/rcs/universal-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RCS</a> powered experience, where it also replaces you SMS app.</p>

        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <p><strong>I think that this is self-explanatory enough.</strong> HEY organizes your emails, so why can't it also organize your agenda (life). Need I say more? Every other email app does it, so why doesn't HEY?</p>
